# FCC-Choropleth-Map
Choropleth Map of educational levels in United States

Use html, css and javascript (babel) to draw a map of the United States to a webpage with county lines drawn. Color this map based on percentage of educational achievements from an external resource (map and educational data provided by freecodecamp). Hovering over the map should display an information box at the mouse giving more detailed information.

This is a project for freecodecamp.org.
